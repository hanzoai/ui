## Development

### Start by cloning the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:hanzo-ui/ui.git
```

### Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

### Run a workspace

You can use the `pnpm --filter=[WORKSPACE]` command to start the development process for a workspace.

#### Examples

1. To run the `ui.hanzo.ai` website:

```
pnpm --filter=www dev
```

2. To run the `hanzo-ui` package:

```
pnpm --filter=hanzo-ui dev
```

## Documentation

The documentation for this project is located in the `www` workspace. You can run the documentation locally by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter=www dev
```

Documentation is written using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). You can find the documentation files in the `apps/www/content/docs` directory.

## Components

We use a registry system for developing components. You can find the source code for the components under `apps/www/registry`. The components are organized by styles.

```bash
apps
└── www
    └── registry
        ├── default
        │   ├── example
        │   └── ui
        └── new-york
            ├── example
            └── ui
```

When adding or modifying components, please ensure that:

1. You make the changes for every style.
2. You update the documentation.
3. You run `pnpm build:registry` to update the registry.

## Requests for new components

If you have a request for a new component, please open a discussion on GitHub. We'll be happy to help you out.

## CLI

The `hanzo-ui` package is a CLI for adding components to your project. You can find the documentation for the CLI [here](https://ui.hanzo.ai/docs/cli).

Any changes to the CLI should be made in the `packages/cli` directory. If you can, it would be great if you could add tests for your changes.

## Testing

Tests are written using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run all the tests from the root of the repository.

```bash
pnpm test
```

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features, please include tests.
