## Overview

The AI Agents component provides a visual workflow designer for creating, managing, and orchestrating multiple AI agents. It includes drag-and-drop agent placement, task assignment, real-time monitoring, and inter-agent communication visualization.

## Features

- **Visual Workflow Designer** - Drag-and-drop canvas for building agent workflows
- **5 Agent Types** - Research, Code, Analysis, Creative, and Automation agents
- **Task Management** - Assign tasks with priority, estimated time, and descriptions
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Track agent performance, success rates, and active tasks
- **Agent Communication** - Animated connections showing data flow between agents
- **Performance Metrics** - Tasks completed, success rate, and average completion time

## Agent Types

### Research Agent

- **Capabilities**: Web search, data analysis, fact-checking, source validation
- **Icon**: Search
- **Color**: Blue
- **Best for**: Information gathering, market research, competitive analysis

### Code Agent

- **Icon**: Code
- **Color**: Green
- **Best for**: Development tasks, refactoring, code reviews

### Analysis Agent

- **Capabilities**: Data processing, pattern recognition, insights, reporting
- **Icon**: Brain
- **Color**: Purple
- **Best for**: Data analysis, business intelligence, trend detection

### Creative Agent

- **Capabilities**: Content creation, design, brainstorming, storytelling
- **Icon**: Palette

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```tsx
import { AIAgents } from "@/components/ui/ai-agents"

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <AIAgents
      workflowMode="custom"
      onAgentCreate={(agent) => {
        console.log("New agent created:", agent)
      }}
      onTaskAssign={(task, agentId) => {
        console.log("Task assigned:", task, "to agent:", agentId)
      }}
      onWorkflowSave={(workflow) => {
        console.log("Workflow saved:", workflow)
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

### With Initial Agents

```tsx
const initialAgents = [
  {
    id: "1",
    name: "Research Bot",
    type: "research",
    capabilities: ["web-search", "data-analysis"],
    status: "idle",
    position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
    connections: [],
    performance: {
      tasksCompleted: 0,
      successRate: 100,
      avgCompletionTime: 0,
    },
  },
]

<AIAgents agents={initialAgents} />
```

### Custom Workflow Mode

```tsx
// Sequential: Agents execute tasks one after another
<AIAgents workflowMode="sequential" />

// Parallel: All agents work simultaneously
<AIAgents workflowMode="parallel" />

// Custom: Manual connection and orchestration
<AIAgents workflowMode="custom" />
```

## Component Structure

### Three Main Tabs

1. **Workflow Designer**
   - Visual canvas with grid background
   - Draggable agent cards
   - Animated connection lines
   - Real-time communication flow

2. **Agent Manager**
   - Grid view of all agents
   - Status badges and current tasks
   - Performance statistics
   - Capability tags

3. **Monitoring**
   - System overview dashboard
   - Active agent count
   - Workflow status
   - Per-agent performance metrics

## Task Assignment

Tasks include:

- **Title** - Short task description
- **Description** - Detailed requirements
- **Priority** - Low, Medium, or High
- **Estimated Time** - Time in hours
- **Assigned Agent** - Which agent will execute the task

Agents can only be assigned tasks when in "idle" status.

## Performance Tracking

Each agent tracks:

- **Tasks Completed** - Total number of finished tasks
- **Success Rate** - Percentage of successful completions
- **Avg Completion Time** - Average time in minutes per task

## Agent Communication

The workflow designer visualizes agent connections with:

- **Animated Lines** - Show active data flow
- **Directional Arrows** - Indicate data direction
- **Pulse Effects** - Highlight active transfers
- **Color Coding** - Blue for active, gray for inactive

## Workflow Controls

- **Create Agent** - Add new agent to workflow
- **Assign Task** - Give tasks to idle agents
- **Run Workflow** - Start all agents
- **Stop Workflow** - Pause all agents
- **Save Workflow** - Export configuration

## Drag & Drop

Agents on the workflow designer can be:

- **Clicked** - Select for details
- **Dragged** - Reposition on canvas
- **Edited** - Modify settings (button)
- **Deleted** - Remove from workflow (button)

## State Management

The component manages:

- Agent positions and connections
- Task assignments and progress
- Workflow execution state
- Selected agent tracking

All updates trigger callbacks for external persistence.

## Customization

### Styling

```tsx
<AIAgents className="min-h-[800px] rounded-lg border" />
```

### Add Custom Agent Types

Extend `agentTypeConfig` in the component for custom agent types with unique icons, colors, and capabilities.

### Persist Workflows

Use `onWorkflowSave` callback to save to database:

```tsx
const handleSave = (workflow) => {
  fetch("/api/workflows", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify(workflow),
  })
}

;<AIAgents onWorkflowSave={handleSave} />
```

## Examples

### Research → Code → Analysis Pipeline

```tsx
const pipeline = [
  { id: "1", name: "Researcher", type: "research", position: { x: 50, y: 50 } },
  { id: "2", name: "Developer", type: "code", position: { x: 400, y: 50 } },
  { id: "3", name: "Analyzer", type: "analysis", position: { x: 750, y: 50 } },
]

const connections = [
  { id: "c1", source: "1", target: "2" },
  { id: "c2", source: "2", target: "3" },
]

<AIAgents agents={pipeline} />
```

### Multi-Agent Content Creation

```tsx
const contentTeam = [
  { id: "1", name: "Researcher", type: "research" },
  { id: "2", name: "Writer", type: "creative" },
  { id: "3", name: "Editor", type: "analysis" },
]

<AIAgents agents={contentTeam} workflowMode="sequential" />
```
