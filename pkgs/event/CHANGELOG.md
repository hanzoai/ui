# @hanzo/capture

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#240](https://github.com/hanzoai/ui/pull/240) [`8b5164a`](https://github.com/hanzoai/ui/commit/8b5164a6e122f774bad151384bb732a3dac31493) Thanks [@zeekay](https://github.com/zeekay)! - Add `@hanzo/capture` — the shared product-analytics capture client. Batched
  pageview/event/identify/group emit to Hanzo Cloud (`/v1/analytics` +
  `/v1/tracker`) with first-touch UTM/referrer/refCode attribution,
  beacon-on-unload, dual cookie/bearer auth, and the shared event + goal + cohort
  vocabulary (`EVENTS`, `GOALS`, `COHORTS`). Framework-agnostic core plus a
  `@hanzo/capture/react` provider and hooks.
